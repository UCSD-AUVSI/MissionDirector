Format 1 of 1: "command"/"args"
----------------------------------------------

{"command":"AAA", "args":BBB}

where AAA signifies the intent of the message (what you want to command the remote entity to do)
BBB is another dictionary containing extra arguments / data that the remote entity will need to carry out that command

example, to start image capturing on the plane:
{"command":"imaging", "args":{"do":"start"}}

example, to start image capturing on the plane from the HumanOperatorClient:
remotemsg = {"command":"imaging", "args":{"do":"start"}}
{"command":"planeobc:", "args":{"message":json.dumps(remotemsg)}}
